# Summary:

- Practical Objectives:
The objective of this project is to design an Android application based on a spectrum of artificial intelligence algorithms for educational purposes targeting doctoral students in hematology. The application aims to assist users in the clinical diagnosis of blood cancer and the evaluation of laboratory personnel.

- Research Type:
The research project falls under the applied category and involves the development of equipment in a research production line. The study primarily focuses on clinical sciences.

- Introduction:

Blood cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer in societies, affecting various age groups. Hematological malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, afflict approximately 280,000 individuals worldwide annually [1]. Leukemia, as one of the most common hematological malignancies, is progressive cancer originating from the uncontrolled proliferation and incomplete differentiation of blood cells, exerting an adverse impact on other blood components and the bone marrow. This condition compromises the immune system's functionality [1]. Moreover, it can restrict the bone marrow's ability to produce red blood cells and platelets. Additionally, the malignant white blood cells present in the bloodstream can cause damage to other organs and systems, including the liver, kidneys, spleen, and central nervous system. Blood cancer encompasses a range of malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Accurate diagnosis of these leukemia subtypes requires invasive procedures, such as bone marrow biopsy and bone marrow aspiration. However, these methods necessitate an operating room and impose significant financial burdens on the healthcare system, in addition to serious risks and complications for the patients, such as bleeding [2].

In this research, for the first time, a collection of deep learning algorithms will be employed to develop a robust model, referred to as Rubast, for the diagnosis of different types of leukemia. This model has not been previously introduced in past studies and utilizes various image processing techniques, image normalization, and extraction of hidden image features. By utilizing the proposed framework, it can serve as a powerful screening tool prior to invasive procedures like bone marrow biopsy, aiding in patient selection for further diagnostic investigations.
